# Meal Catalog Browsing app for Coding Ninja

This is a meal searching application. This application behind the scene consumes
[MealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) for data. This application features
google-search like meal searching features. Users can browse any search result to know
more about any food. Users can add different foods as their favourite meals. There is a
dedicated "Favourite Meals" page that users can browse to view their favourite foods. Users
can also remove any food from their favourite foods from this page. 

Favourite foods are stored in `localStorage` which means data don't get lost between page refreshes
and stay afloat across browser sessions.
